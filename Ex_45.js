 Cars: 
 Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object. The function should always receive a manufacturer 
 and a model name. It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. Call the function with the 
 required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a color or an optional feature. Print the Object 
 thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly.
